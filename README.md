# Brain-Cancer-Detection-Al-Model
Duration: Aug 2024 â€“ Nov 2024

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, CNN

 This project involves building a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain cancer from medical images. The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans and classifies images into cancerous or non-cancerous categories. Image preprocessing techniques were used to enhance accuracy. Validation was done using standard metrics such as accuracy and loss. This project demonstrates the use of AI in medical diagnostics and real-world healthcare applications.
